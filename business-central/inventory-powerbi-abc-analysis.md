# ABC Analysis (Power BI Report)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-2026w1](includes/applies-to-2026w1.md)]

The **ABC Analysis** report performs an ABC analysis of your sales data, categorizing items based on their contribution to total sales. Use the report to identify key items to prioritize supply and sales efforts.

> [!NOTE]
> The default ABC class boundaries can be customized through the [Power BI ABC Analysis Setup](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36982). More information regarding this setup is available here [ABC Analysis Setup](across-powerbi-install-business-central-apps.md#abc-analysis-setup).

## Use the report

This report is designed for leadership and management to optimize supply chain and sales strategies based on item value.

Management teams use the report to identify key item classifications at a high-level. Using the ABC classification insights, leaders can strategize effective procurement methods to prioritize items contributing the most sales value.

For example, using the ABC Class Details you identify that three items are assigned class 'A,' contributing to 50% of total sales. In response, you implement re-ordering strategies to optimize stock-levels for high value items and re-arrange bin content placements for more effective warehouse movements of high-frequency items. 

Similarly, by reviewing the items assigned to class C, which only contribute to 20% of sales, you decide to optimize product offerings by reducing inventory. This streamlines inventory management by more effectively utilizing warehouse users and resources.
